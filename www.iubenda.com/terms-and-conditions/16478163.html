      <h2 id="common-provisions">Common provisions</h2>

<h3 id="no-waiver">No Waiver</h3>
<p>The Owner’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of any such right or provision.  No waiver shall be considered a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term.</p>
<h3 id="service-interruption">Service interruption</h3>
<p>To ensure the best possible service level, the Owner reserves the right to interrupt the Service for maintenance, system updates or any other changes, informing the Users appropriately.</p>

<p>Within the limits of law, the Owner may also decide to suspend or discontinue the Service altogether. If the Service is discontinued, the Owner will cooperate with Users to enable them to withdraw personal data or information and will respect Users' rights relating to continued product use and/or compensation, as provided for by applicable law.</p>

<p>Additionally, the Service might not be available due to reasons outside the Owner’s reasonable control, such as “force majeure” events (infrastructural breakdowns or blackouts etc.).</p>
<h3 id="service-reselling">Service reselling</h3>
<p>Users may not reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of this Application and of its Service without the Owner’s express prior written permission, granted either directly or through a legitimate reselling program.</p>

<p>To learn more about the use of their personal data, Users may refer to the privacy policy of this Application.</p>
<h3 id="intellectual-property-rights">Intellectual property rights</h3>
<p>Without prejudice to any more specific provision of these Terms, any intellectual property rights, such as copyrights, trademark rights, patent rights and design rights related to this Application are the exclusive property of the Owner or its licensors and are subject to the protection granted by applicable laws or international treaties relating to intellectual property.</p>

<p>All trademarks — nominal or figurative — and all other marks, trade names, service marks, word marks, illustrations, images, or logos appearing in connection with this Application are, and remain, the exclusive property of the Owner or its licensors and are subject to the protection granted by applicable laws or international treaties related to intellectual property.</p>
<h3 id="changes-to-these-terms">Changes to these Terms</h3>
<p>The Owner reserves the right to amend or otherwise modify these Terms at any time. In such cases, the Owner will appropriately inform the User of these changes.</p>

<p>Such changes will only affect the relationship with the User from the date communicated to Users onwards.</p>

<p><strong>The continued use of the Service will signify the User’s acceptance of the revised Terms.</strong> If Users do not wish to be bound by the changes, they must stop using the Service and may terminate the Agreement.</p>

<p>The applicable previous version will govern the relationship prior to the User's acceptance. The User can obtain any previous version from the Owner.</p>
<p>If legally required, the Owner will notify Users in advance of when the modified Terms will take effect.</p>
<h3 id="assignment-of-contract">Assignment of contract</h3>
<p>The Owner reserves the right to transfer, assign, dispose of by novation, or subcontract any or all rights or obligations under these Terms, taking the User’s legitimate interests into account.

<h3 id="contacts">Contacts</h3>
<p>All communications relating to the use of this Application must be sent using the contact information stated in this document.</p>
<h3 id="severability">Severability</h3>
<p>Should any provision of these Terms be deemed or become invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions, which shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
<h4 id="us-users">US Users</h4>
<p>Any such invalid or unenforceable provision will be interpreted, construed and reformed to the extent reasonably required to render it valid, enforceable and consistent with its original intent.
These Terms constitute the entire Agreement between Users and the Owner with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all other communications, including but not limited to all prior agreements, between the parties with respect to such subject matter.
These Terms will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
<h4 id="eu-users">EU Users</h4>
<p>Should any provision of these Terms be or be deemed void, invalid or unenforceable, the parties shall do their best to find, in an amicable way, an agreement on valid and enforceable provisions thereby substituting the void, invalid or unenforceable parts.<br>
In case of failure to do so, the void, invalid or unenforceable provisions shall be replaced by the applicable statutory provisions, if so permitted or stated under the applicable law.</p>

<p>Without prejudice to the above, the nullity, invalidity or impossibility to enforce a particular provision of these Terms shall not nullify the entire Agreement, unless the severed provisions are essential to the Agreement, or of such importance that the parties would not have entered into the contract if they had known that the provision would not be valid, or in cases where the remaining provisions would translate into an unacceptable hardship on any of the parties.</p>
<h3 id="governing-law">Governing law</h3>
<p>These Terms are governed by the law of the place where the Owner is based, as disclosed in the relevant section of this document, without regard to conflict of laws principles.</p>

<h3 id="venue-of-jurisdiction">Venue of jurisdiction</h3>
